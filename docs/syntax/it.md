# It
`it`s are the examples of the spec. A `Description` holds a group of `it`s, where each `it` has at least one expectation.

An `it` has the form of

```cpp
it("description string", _ {...})
```

An `it` can also have an implicit description that is generated by the contained expectation

```cpp
it(_{...})
```

!!! important

    Take note of the `_`. This is used whenever you write an `it`, similar to `$` for `describe`.


Each `it` is run as part of the containing parent `Description`, whether that be the toplevel
`describe` or an `explain`.

So for example,

```cpp
describe an_example_it("An example of an it", $ {
	it("looks like this", {...});
});
```
