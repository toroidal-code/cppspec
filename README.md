A behavior-driven development testing library for C++ with an RSpec-inspired DSL.

## Documentation

See [http://cppspec.readthedocs.org/](http://cppspec.readthedocs.org/) for full documentation and a tutorial.

## Requirements

C++Spec requires a compiler and standard library with support for C++23: Currently tested and confirmed working are:
- LLVM/Clang 18 (on Linux, macOS, and Windows)
- GCC 14.2 (on Linux and macOS)
- MSVC 19.43 (on Windows)
- AppleClang 16 (on macOS)

__Note:__ Only the tests require being compiled with C++23 support (`-std=c++23`). No other part of an existing project's build must be modified.

## Usage
The recommended usage is as a subproject integrated into your build system. For CMake this would look something like below:
```cmake
FetchContent_Declare(
  c++spec
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/toroidal-code/cppspec
  GIT_TAG        VERSION
)

# Or using CPM
CPMAddPackage("gh:toroidal-code/cppspec@VERSION")
```

Specs can then be automatically added as targets with
```cmake
discover_specs(specs_folder)
```
This will create a separate executable for every file ending in `_spec.cpp` in the given directory (recursive) and add them to CTest.

## Introduction

If you've ever used RSpec or Jasmine, chances are you'll be familiar with C++Spec's syntax. For example, this is a C++Spec version of the first snippet on RSpec's [README](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/master/README.md#basic-structure).

```cpp
#include "cppspec.hpp"
#include "order.hpp"

describe order_spec("Order", $ {
  it("sums the prices of its line items", _ {
    Order order();

	order.add_entry(LineItem().set_item(Item()
	  .set_price(Money(1.11, Money::USD))
	));

	order.add_entry(LineItem().set_item(Item()
	  .set_price(Money(1.11, Money::USD))
	  .set_quantity(2)
	));

	expect(order.total()).to_equal(Money(5.55, Money::USD));
  });
});

CPPSPEC_MAIN(order_spec);
```
